# Lazyros
A simple terminal-based UI for ROS2 development, inspired by [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)

### Why Lazyros
Robotic development can be complicated. Multiple terminal windows, several synchronous processes, etc. can cause confusion. Tools such as `rqt` already exist, but `lazyros` makes improvements:

- **Fast + Lightweight**: Built with Rust with zero overhead
- **No GUI needed**: Perfect over ssh on headless robots
- **Live Monitoring**: Real-time frequency + data throughput for topics
- **Quick Actions**: Restart nodes, echo topics, or edit parameters with one key
